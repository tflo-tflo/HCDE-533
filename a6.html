          My new printer arrived so I spent some time setting it up, calibrating, and printing thresholds tests for each of my filments. I wasn't sure how much of a difference each filament would have so it was good to verify.

          Last week my printed prototypes were to check the plisse texture, printing orientation, tree support settings, and suss out what kind of joint technique I wanted to use. This week I started on mortise and tenon joint tests with an emphasis on nailing down precision and accuracy. But then I entered a 3D printing black hole...

          And then I started to have issues with the translucent filament. It would change from translucent to opaque roughly 30% of the build on the z index.

          <br>
          Things I tried to troubleshoot (again, thanks Nathan): Decreasing and increasing nozzle temperature; re-calibrating machine; tested a different model file; printing along the Y axis of the printing bed; turned off cooling; factory reset. In the end, it took a combination of a factory reset and lowering the temperature to get the filament back to what it was. I was worried so I did a series of sample tests for different number of walls and infill density.

          I think I took a lot of circutous routes to do this assignment. Some things I'll try next time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Model the whole build first as quickly as possible. It will help to think about all the parts needed, which elements that will need testing, and which parts to do in Grasshopper vs manually. I didn't do this but instead only sketched out the concept on paper and started mkaing small model samples for testing. My intention was to make this modular but because I didn't plan the build as a whole, I ended up with segments that made it hard to make it modular.</li>
          <li>When doing joint and texture tests, print the smallest area needed to know what you need to know.</li>
          <li>Printing supports and brims are tricky on smaller areas, especially around the joints. I thought a lot about the oritentation of my prints. In my early tests I found it difficult to remove the extra support layer. I bought a filing kit to fix these in post but the overall quality is less than satisfying and the work tedious. In the end, I changed my design file, such as trimming its height, so that I can print without supports or a brim.</li>
          <li>Buy enough filament. I ran out towards the end and had to switch material which led to some fit issues. The second filament has a rougher texture so it made the joint connections ... impossible.</li>
          <li>Of the three filaments I tried, I liked the Fusion brand the most. The way the filament is spooled reduces the filament getting tangled or 'knotted'. The PETG from Bambu got is a bit stiffer and it spooled very tightly. This led to the filament snapping out of the hot end a few times.</li>
      </ul>
