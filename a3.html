            <li>A 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings</li>
            <li>A 2 cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer and your favorite print setting from the previous cubes.</li>
            <li>A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness</li>
            <li>A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment</li>
            <li>A cylinder 3cm in diameter with special mode "spiralize outer contour".</li>
            <li>A cylinder 3cm in diameter printed on its side with supports on.</li>
            <li>Design (in software of your choice) 3D printed clips that allow you to clip cardboard sheets together. You can use flexures like shown in class, or any other method to make your clips. Your clipped together cardboard needs to pass a shake test; include a shaking gif on your webpage. You must 3D print at least 15 clips. They do not need to be identical, but they can be.</li>

          <p>I salvaged an older printer left at work, a Monoprice Select Mini V2. It took some troubleshooting to get it working, including taking apart the hot end. But once I got it going, I test printed cubes.</p>

          <p>I decided to print the rest of the assignment at school because the Prusas have a larger bed and I'm guessing would print quicker. It was an ordeal. No matter what variables Celina and I set and no matter what other preparation we did, including wiping the surface with isopropyl alcohol, purging filament, cleaning the nozzle, there was a 50% chance the print would go well. We did an experiment where we took the same file and settings from another classmate; only one of us was successful. We were at the lab for almost 8 hours and it wasn't until another student came by to pick up their print that I asked him for advice. He recommended we use Prusa's own slicer software. Once we did that, our prints were going faster without fussing with the settings and the quality difference is noticeable.</p>
