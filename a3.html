            <li>A 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings</li>
            <li>A 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings</li>
            <li>A 2 cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer and your favorite print setting from the previous cubes.</li>
            <li>A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness</li>
            <li>A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment</li>
            <li>A cylinder 3cm in diameter with special mode "spiralize outer contour".</li>
            <li>A cylinder 3cm in diameter printed on its side with supports on.</li>
            <li>Design (in software of your choice) 3D printed clips that allow you to clip cardboard sheets together. You can use flexures like shown in class, or any other method to make your clips. Your clipped together cardboard needs to pass a shake test; include a shaking gif on your webpage. You must 3D print at least 15 clips. They do not need to be identical, but they can be.</li>

          <p>To get surface adhesion I tried a few techniques. I increased the temperature to 200-210 celsisus and depending on the model, would slow down the initial few layers down between 50-85% speed.</p>

          <p>I did my initial prototyping at home with a smaller, older 3D printer I salvaged from work. This helped get through iterations on the design before heading to the Mill.</p>
